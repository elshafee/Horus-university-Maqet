# Horus-university-Maqet
this is the code of horus university maqet 
### this is a small maqet of horus university 
### as electrical  we used led 1 watt about 20 led 
and we used lm7805 regulator with power supply 12 v 30 A
also we used shotkey diod to mange the power from batteries and power supply
we used arduino mega to control the led with relay for every building 
also we used ultrasonic, bluetooth module and LDR
we used ultrasonic to make the arduino turn on light when some one is pass near the maqet
we used LDR to use it when someone is pointing to any building to turn on the building light and type it's name on the lcd
we used Bluetooth module to control the maqet from an android appliction which we built it from scratch
we used 2x16 lcd to present team members name and data of the maqet
